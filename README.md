```

### Customizing

**Add your own Windows applications:**

1. **Railway**: Modify `railway/setup-desktop.sh`
2. **Local**: Create desktop shortcuts in `~/Desktop/`

**Example custom application:**
```bash
cat > ~/Desktop/My\ App.desktop << EOF
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Name=My Windows App
Exec=wine /path/to/app.exe
Icon=applications-wine
Terminal=false
EOF
```

**Local**: Run `~/wine-manager/healthcheck.sh`

### Common Issues

| Issue | Railway Solution | Local Solution |
|-------|------------------|----------------|

| **VNC not accessible** | Verify health check | Check port availability |
| **Roblox won't start** | Wait for Wine init | Restart Wine prefix |
